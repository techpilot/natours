# Natours Application

**Natours** is a Node.js web application that allows visitors to register for tours. The website's home page displays all available tours. To register for a tour, a user must authenticate themselves, navigate to the tour details page, and click the registration button. Clicking the register button redirects the user to a Stripe checkout page where they can make a payment for the selected tour.

If the payment is successful, Stripe redirects the user back to the application. On the user's profile page, they can view all the tours they have registered for, along with the corresponding tour dates. Additionally, users can change their password and edit their profile details.


**Functionalities**: Data Modeling for easy, flexible, **fast, and secure** interaction with the MongoDB database, Authentication and Authorization, Password reset, Payment Integration with Stripe, and Map Integration with Mapbox. 



This web application was built using modern technologies: 
  - **Node js**, 
  - **Express**: A nodejs backend framework for easy development of backend applications and apis with nodejs. 
  - **MongoDB & Mongoose**: a document database for flexible development of applications.
  - **Stripe**: a complex, secure and easy-to-use tool for accepting payments in an application.
  - **Mapbox**: with Mapbox, you can integrate map and geolocation in your application.
  - **Heroku**: a platform for hosting applications and other cloud services.
